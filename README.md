Analysis of gold and S&amp;P 500 market behavior during the 2008 financial crisis

## Overview
This project explores how gold and the S&P 500 behaved during the 2008 financial crisis using historical financial data. It examines daily returns, volatility, and correlation to understand goldâ€™s role as a potential safe-haven asset.

## Objectives
- Analyze gold and S&P 500 price behavior from 2004 to 2025
- Compare their volatility during major crises
- Assess the correlation between gold and stock market returns

## Data Sources
- Gold price data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/novandraanugrah/xauusd-gold-price-historical-data-2004present)
- S&P 500 data: Yahoo Finance (retrieved using the `yfinance` Python library)

## Methodology
- Calculated daily returns using percentage change
- Computed 30-day rolling annualized volatility
- Visualized crisis periods (e.g., October 2008)
- Measured correlation between gold and S&P 500 returns

## Key Insights
- Gold prices remained relatively stable during the 2008 crisis
- S&P 500 experienced sharper volatility spikes and declines
- Correlation between daily returns of gold and the S&P 500 was very low (~0.05), supporting the idea that gold acts as a hedge or safe-haven asset during market uncertainty
